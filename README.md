# FaceSwap
# Overview
This is a Face Swapping Website created using Python, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. The website allows users to upload two images: one for the source face and another for the target face. The deep learning model then swaps the faces in the images, producing a new image with the swapped faces.

# Features
- Face swapping between two images.
- User-friendly web interface.
- Real-time processing using deep learning and computer vision.
- Option to save/download the swapped image.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask (for creating the web application)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Deep Learning Framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Pretrained Face Recognition Model (e.g., Dlib, OpenFace)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge for the web interface (if customizing)

### To use this project:
- `git clone https://github.com/CaptaiN785/FaceSwap.git`
- `cd FaceSwap`
- `cd FaceSwapping`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For Windows: `python app.py`, For other `python3 app.py`
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
- Upload the source and target images.
- Click the `Swap Faces` button.
- The swapped image will be displayed on the web page.

Happy face swapping! If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or reach out to the project maintainers.
